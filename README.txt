Uses PGMIDI library (extension of CoreMIDI)

Plug in an instrument with a MIDI to USB cable to your computer or to iPhone/iPad using a converter (the iRig MIDI or the Camera Connection Kit for iPad)

Connect wirelessly to your computer using the Audio MIDI setup. Note that MIDI Learn function (changing a knob on the instrument is picked up automatically) does not work when using live routing through Apple's Audio MIDI Setup. Use MidiPipe instead.
